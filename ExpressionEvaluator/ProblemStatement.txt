Problem Statement:
You are given a string representing a mathematical expression consisting of digits, operators (+, -, *, /), and parentheses ((, )). Write a function/method to evaluate the expression and return the result.

Input:
A string representing a valid mathematical expression. The expression can contain:

Digits (0-9)
Operators (+, -, *, /)
Parentheses ((, ))
Output:
Return the evaluated result of the mathematical expression as an integer.

Example:
Input: "3 + 4 * (2 - 1)"

Output: 7

Input: "(1 + 2) * 3 - 6 / 2"

Output: 9

Constraints:
The input string is guaranteed to be valid and well-formed.
Assume all operations are integer operations (no floating point arithmetic needed).
The expression may contain spaces which can be ignored during parsing.
