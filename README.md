# Algorithms and Data Structures Challenges

:star2: This repository contains solutions to various algorithms and data structures challenges implemented in C#.

## Problems Included

1. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
   - Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

2. Merge Intervals
   - Merge all overlapping intervals in a list of intervals.

3. LRU Cache
   - Implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache data structure.

4. Find Median from Data Stream
   - Design a data structure that supports finding the median of numbers as they are added.

## Setup

To run the code examples, you will need:

* .NET Core SDK installed on your machine.

## Usage

Each project is a standalone console application. You can run these examples directly from the command line by navigating to the project directory and using dotnet run.

Example:

```
cd LongestSubstring
```
