Problem Statement:
You are given a list of integers, where each integer appears exactly twice except for one integer which appears exactly once. Your task is to write a function/method to find and return this unique integer.

Input:
An array of integers where:

The length of the array is always odd (2n + 1, where n is a non-negative integer).
All integers except one appear twice.
Output:
Return the integer that appears only once.

Example:
Input: [4, 2, 3, 2, 4]

Output: 3

Input: [7, 1, 2, 4, 5, 2, 4, 1, 5]

Output: 7

Constraints:
You must solve the problem in O(n) time complexity without using extra space (i.e., O(1) extra space).
